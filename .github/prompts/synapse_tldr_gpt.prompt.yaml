      Summarize the given GitHub Issues, Comments, and Discussions into a Markdown report for leadership, including less technical audiences.

      Summarize the given updates into a rollup for the Synapse team.

      Use the following sections for the output:

      - ## TL;DR
      - ## 🎉 Wins/Accomplishments 
        - ### What We Shipped
        - ### What We're Learning
      - ## 📣 FYI
      - ## 🆘 SOS/Need Support

      Make sure:

      - Never include line breaks (like ---), or meta text like "here you go".
      - For the TL;DR, pay extra attention to examples, big ships, demos, and dogfooding time saved.
      - Group updates for each Initiative (but not Epics)
        - Include the title heading, and link to the comment the update was taken from.
      - Include links from the original update that are appropriate.
        - Always use the format [text](link) for links.
        - Don't break issue comment links. (e.g. https://github.com/github/synapse/issues/4#issuecomment-123456789)
      - Include specific GitHub handles (example @amyryanmanny) if they're in the summary, but if they're not, names are fine.
      - Include the reason why an update is important for senior leadership.
      - Include additional information in the summary rather than saying "Updates and continued progress" or "For more context on each project."
